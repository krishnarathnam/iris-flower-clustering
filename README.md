# iris-flower-clustering
Implemented K-Means clustering from scratch using NumPy on the Iris dataset. Only used scikit-learn to load the data. Built custom functions for centroid initialization, Euclidean distance calculation, cluster assignment, and centroid updates, gaining a deep understanding of unsupervised learning.
